Im getting ready to go camping with my family next weekend as well. It will be the first time that my kids have gone camping with me. <THEM> Aw that will be a great time then How old are your kids? <YOU> My kids are 14 and 12. So theyre fairly independent but I also know that they want to do a lot of cooking during our camping trip. Thus I think that Im going to need more firewood as I expect that well be having a lot of fires while were out. How about you? What are you planning to do on your camping trip? <THEM> Good ages. They should be able to help out. Were planning to do a big bonfire maybe some smores and hopefully find a lake. Were looking for extra firewood and water for the bonfire and to keep hydrated <YOU> That sounds like a blast. I would like to propose that you take 2 waters and 1 firewood and Ill take 2 firewoods and 1 water for our respective trips. Does that work for you? <THEM> Yes we are all looking forward to it. Thanks for being amenable and trying to make this work. That might be okay but could we take take the 3 packages of food? Since we wont be doing as big of a bonfire I am sure well hike more or swim and need the extra energy <YOU> I was hoping to take at least some of the food with me. As you know those teenagers seem to hungry ALL the time. Its like feeding fuel into a bottomless pit. So Im definitely going to need some of the food for my trip as well. <THEM> Hm okay. Would 1 packet of food be sufficient? I know they are growing but my friends are ex football players and can eat 3x the normal person <YOU> Those exfootball players can eat way more than the average person. I would be OK with that deal. I will get 2 firewood 1 water and 1 food. Youll get 1 firewood 2 water and 2 food. Ill go ahead and submit this deal for you to agree to. Thanks for negotiating and have a great camping trip! <THEM> lets submit this deal. i get 2 food 2 water and 1 firewood. you get 1 food 1 water and 2 firewood.","<YOU> this deal is acceptable.","<CONTEXT> opponent highest priority is Firewood opponent medium priority is Water opponent lowest priority is Food"

"<CONTEXT> my highest priority is Firewood because We need to dry out in case it rains. Also keeps away mosquitoes. my medium priority is Water because Water source at camping site in unreliable. We need our own water. my lowest priority is Food because We need extra energy to go hiking. <HISTORY> <THEM> Hello fellow camper. <YOU> Hi there. Quite a trip we have lined up. <THEM> Yes it is. What items would you like to have? <YOU> I hear it might rain. We would need to keep fire longer to dry off our clothes. Firewood would come in very handy. <THEM> Well I would like 2 firewood 2 food and 2 water. <YOU> Are some of them more important to you than others? Im really concerned about having firewood. Food is not as important. <THEM> Im not really that concerned about water especially as it might be wet weather. <YOU> Whats your take on food? We heed it to maintain energy while hiking but I think well not do as much of that. Well mostly stay by the camp site. <THEM> I tend to get low blood sugar and need to eat if I start feeling faint. How about I take 2 firewood 2 food and 1 water? <YOU> How about you take 1 firewood 3 food 1 water instead? You will still get 5 out of 9 items we have. <THEM> That would work for me. <YOU> Sounds good. <THEM> lets submit this deal. i get 3 food 1 water and 1 firewood. you get 0 food 2 water and 2 firewood.","<YOU> this deal is acceptable.","<CONTEXT> opponent highest priority is Firewood opponent medium priority is Food opponent lowest priority is Water"
