I hope youre having a good week and staying well. So we are negotiating on supplies! <YOU> Yes. Hoping we can make a good deal. <THEM> Me too! Im hoping for two food items and one water. Im diabetic so if my blood sugar drops I may need the extra carbs. And water because water is important! <YOU> I prefer two water and one food. I can understand why you need the extra food items. Im not much of a snacker but do drink a lot of water all the time. Keeps me from eating more! <THEM> Lol it seems it was easy for us to come to a deal! Im super bad at drinking water trying to get better so I dont feel Ill need as much.

Its so hot that I dont cherish the idea of a fire BUT it does keep the bugs at bay! <THEM> Ooh I didnt think of that! Im not a huge fan of fire but Im even less a fan of bugs. Im good with two in that case. I think we still have to meet the 10 message minimum before we can submit a deal. So hows your day going? <YOU> So far so good but it is too hot outside to enjoy. I have been watering the garden and trying to convince my dog to come out and play but she is not interested. <THEM> Lol its hot here too! We are always in the 110118 degrees out in the desert. What kind of dog do you have? <YOU> She is a Corgi with a fluffy coat so she is not a big fan of the heat. I guess you get a dry heat near the desert. We have a lot of humidity which is oppressive.

I find it hard to hunt or fish so I am looking for some extra food <THEM> Sounds like something we can split equitably then. My metabolism is kind of slow so I dont usually need to eat that much. <YOU> Well thats good! <THEM> I agree. So could I trade you the extra food for the firewood? And well have to figure out what to do with this spare water I suppose. <YOU> Ok I am more than happy to give you 3 firefood for 3 food? <THEM> Im perfectly happy with that. Do you have suggestions on how to split the water between us? <YOU> Well one of us can get 2 and the other can get 1 since there are 3 we cant evenly split it <THEM> Right. Would you be okay if we just flip a coin if its just of equal importance to the both of us? <YOU> Yes that would be fine you can flip it and I will trust you. I choose tails <THEM> Looks like 2 to you then. So Ill receive 3 firewood 1 water and 0 food. Youll receive 3 water 2 food 0 firewood? <YOU> Yes I get 3 food 2 water 0 firewood.
